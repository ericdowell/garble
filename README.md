Garble is an app I'm developing as a fun side project. I wanted to get an understanding of what it would take to
create an app that uses a form of Polymorphism. This app does just that, it has a basic Text model that is
the gateway for the other underlying Polymorphic models: Note, Post and ToDo.

This is just the beginning, other things to come are as follows:
- [ ] More advanced User Management
- [ ] Permissions/Roles ACL with the use of the built-in Gate
- [ ] More Polymorphic models.

There is much more beyond those things, but that is the short list that I see coming.
