Garble is an app I'm develop as a fun side project, currently this app is very alpha. I wanted to get an understanding of what it would take to create an app that uses a form of Polymorphism. This app does just that, it has a basic Text model that is the gateway for the other underlying Polymorphic models: Note, Page and Todo.

This is just the beginning, other things to come are more advanced User Management, Permissions/Roles ACL with the use of the built-in Gate, and more Polymorphic models. There is much more beyond those things, but that is the short list that I see coming.
